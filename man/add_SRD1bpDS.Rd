}
\arguments{
\item{PANORAMA}{list. PANORAMA object as output by \code{\link{panorama_PANORAMA}}}

\item{group_A}{character. Name of group to be compared as found in PANORAMA$META$group}

\item{group_B}{character. Name of group to be compared as found in PANORAMA$META$group}

\item{newColName}{character. Name of calculated metric to be stored in PANORAMA$RES,
assigned by default based on group_A and group_B}

\item{onNucs}{character. Nucleotide(s) in which the metric will be calculated}

\item{minCov}{integer. Minimal coverage in position for metric to be calculated}
}
\description{
Calculates the start ratio difference 1bp down-stream of group_A minus that
of group_B per set of samples in a PANORAMA object.
