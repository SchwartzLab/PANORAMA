\arguments{
\item{PANORAMA}{list. PANORAMA object as output by \code{\link{panorama_PANORAMA}}}

\item{group_A}{character. Name of group to be compared as found in PANORAMA$META$group}

\item{newColName}{character. Name of calculated metric to be stored in PANORAMA$RES,
assigned by default based on group_A and group_B}

\item{onNucs}{character. Nucleotide(s) in which the metric will be calculated}

\item{minReads}{numeric. Minimum number of reads start/ends in window. Both
flanks and the queried site are summed to calculate this number.}

consider for metric calculation}
